Marina Martin served as the **Chief Technology Officer of the Department of Veterans Affairs** from July 2013 to January 2017, where she built the first agency [United States Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov) team, bringing in America’s top technical talent for tours of duty within the agency to help transform how America serves and honors its Veterans. Her portfolio included [vets.gov](https://www.vets.gov), a single digital destination for Veterans to manage, apply for, manage, and track the benefits they earned, replacing hundreds of disparate and difficult-to-navigate websites across the agency; Caseflow, a core part of the Department’s appeals modernization effort that provides a modern, intuitive, and largely automated interface for processing Veterans’ appeals for VA judges and attorneys; and the Clinician User Interface, a Web-based wizard that streamlines and shortens the disability compensation claim process. Marina’s team was also the first to bring commercial cloud computing and modern development practices, including continuous integration and deployment, to the VA.

She was formerly **Senior Advisor to US CTO Todd Park**, with a portfolio focusing on both the VA and liberating government data to fuel innovation, create jobs, and improve the lives of everyday Americans. As part of the inaugural class of 18 **Presidential Innovation Fellows**, Marina served as the first **Entrepreneur-in-Residence** at the US Department of Education, where she worked with internal and private sector innovators to use open educational data as fuel for apps and services that can help achieve national priorities such as increasing college affordability and completion rates. 

Prior to joining the federal government, Marina was **Founder & CEO** of the business efficiency consulting firm The Type-A Way and **author of** [**Business Efficiency for Dummies**](http://bit.ly/businessefficiencybook).
